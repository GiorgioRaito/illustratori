                    <p><b> Camilo Huinca</b>'s work is rich with colour, content and a brightly illustrated narrative that speaks for it self. <br> Born and raised in Santiago in Chile, Camilo has divided his career between graphic design and painting. Working independently has allowed Camilo to “develop (his) own style, having a main focus on the use of curiosity,” he explains. In 2014 Camilo set up <b>Perfe Studio</b> where he concentrates on graphic design projects in “a more commercial way”. However, within illustration, he described his main motivation as, “to be able to generate a communication method based on simplicity and synthesis, with few tools and colours.”
                        Camilo is fascinated by everyday scenes, moments and personal habits, often depicting scenic bus routes, art galleries and public figures in his own psychedelically shaped style. <i> “Within my work I try to reproduce real moments from an innocent and impartial perspective.” </i> <br> In 2019, a cultural festival was held in the city of Shenzhen and Huinca was invited by <b>Chinese Ministry of Culture</b> to hold an outdoor exhibition of his works. <br>
                        He is represented by the international advertising agency <b>Agent Pekka</b>, with headquarters in Helsinki. <br> In 2021 he made his first collaboration with an American media outlet, illustrating a news item for <b>New York Times</b> newspaper. He created the cover of the English magazine Brummell, for its Summer 2022 edition and illustrations for <i>The New Yorker magazine</i> and <i>The Los Angeles Times newspaper</i>.</p>
