                        Karlotta Freier is a visual narrator who uses the medium of drawing on paper to tell stories. <br> Her illustrations carry the viewer into an intimate dimension - where every image becomes an untold story about real life events and personal fantasies. From ink sketches to colorful acrylics, the German artist fully expresses herself through the use of an elaborated and tailor-made visual language. Each stroke is a discovery of her personal take on life. Besides her works on paper, Karlotta Freier also creates a variety of artist books where she aims to further experiment with the power and intimacy of storytelling through images.
