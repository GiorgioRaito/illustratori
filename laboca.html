                    <p><b>La Boca</b> have the rare, impressive ability to create designs and artwork resembling some of the best album sleeves lurking in your dad’s record collection. <br> The studio, founded in 2002, is based in west London and has gathered an envious collection of awards, including Cannes Lions, European Design Awards, and the <b>AOI Illustration Awards</b>. <br> Their exquisitely executed, psychedelic style is the combined result of each of the studio's members' unique influences, having hailed from London, Bordeaux, Devon and Switzerland.
                        <br> <i>“We work as a studio, so most of our designs are created as a team,” </i> says <b>Scott Bendall</b> of La Boca. <br> <i> “It's not unusual to have two or three people working on a single piece.” </i> Keen to work on more animated projects in the future, the team (based in two studios, one in London and one in Amsterdam) are never short on work from a selection of devoted clients.</p> <br><p>The studio have worked with a wide range of clients, on projects ranging from record covers for underground record labels,
                        through to international advertising campaigns for global brands. <br> Along the way we have collected honours from D&AD,
                        Cannes Lions, European Design Awards, ADC Awards and AIGA.</p>
