                    <p>Swedish illustrator, designer and animator <b>Linn Fritz</b> lives and works in London where she creates charmingly clean, precise imagery in a trademark pastel palette for a wide range of editorial and commercial clients. <br>Her neat, fluid line work was honed during her time at <b>Hyper Island</b>, a time which Linn cites as <i> “hands down one of the best experiences”</i> of her life. <i> “My Hyper Island journey completely changed me as a person” </i> she says, <i>“It pushed me to work harder and gave me the tools to succeed in the real world”</i>. <br> The progressive nature of Hyper Island led Linn to abandon pen and paper and concentrate on what digital could offer her already well-honed drawings. As she puts it, “There’s more freedom drawing digitally, and more room for mistakes.” Alongside her editorial and commercial projects, Linn is the co-founder of Panimation, “a community of equality-driven women. Linn’s the co-founder of <b>Panimation</b>, a community of equality-driven women, trans and non-binary friends aiming to connect and support each other within the animation industry. </p>

                    <p>Clients include: <b> Wired, Android, MTV, Facebook, Vogue Japan, CNN, Google, KFC, SXSW, Aperol Spritz</b> and <b>Twitter</b>.</p>
