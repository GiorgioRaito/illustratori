                    <p>San Francisco-based artist <b>Tim Lahan</b>’s naughty, witty artwork is the product of his ability to digest and illustrate clever glitches, concepts and interesting visual cues from the world around him. 
                       <i>“I generally aim to make things as simple as possible,”</i> says Tim<i>“Sometimes they come out funny”</i>. <br> the <b>ADC Young Gun</b> award winner’s instantly recognisable style is enviably simple and genuinely funny: something very few illustrators can boast. <br>
                        Tim Lahan is an illustrator known for having created various advertising campaigns such as that of Kenzo which represented big eyes on backgrounds with psychedelic colors, a bit like 13th Floor Elevators. <br> In fact, Tim's creations seem to come from a delirious <b>LSD trip</b> (apparently taken well) of bright colors and rainbows that convey a great joie de vivre. <br>The power of his light and carefree language lends itself very well to any type of representation. </p> <p> Tim Lahan is a graphic artist and illustrator based in the USA who splits his time between commercial work and personal projects that include everything from self-publishing to painting.<br>His work has been featured/collected in many different places in print, online, and in the physical world including places like <b>Printed Matter</b>, <b>The New York Public Library</b>, and <b>the MoMA Library</b>.</p>
