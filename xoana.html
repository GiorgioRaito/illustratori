                    <p>The portfolio of LA-based illustrator <b>Xoana Herrera</b> is an explosion of sumptuous, stylish character scenes dwelling in a world that, frankly, looks ideal.<br> Xoana trained as a graphic designer in Argentina but over time found herself drawn to the world of illustration after a five-year stint at Buck agency. Now, alongside founding a feminist creative collective, Get it Girl, she creates graceful, complex and accessible imagery which would be as at home in an ad campaign as it would be in a children’s book (which she's quite keen to try soon).
                        <br> <i> “As an artist I think it is up to us to keep evolving and taking creative decisions,” </i> she says <i>“Aiming to be innovative is something I feel I can dare to try every time I take a job, and that’s amazing”</i>.
                        <br> Originally from Buenos Aires, and currently based in LA, Xoana Herrera has immersed her style into the advertising and animation industry. 
                        The young illustrator Xoana Herrera creates universes in which nature prevails. The artist designs charged spaces, with plants and animals that grow in harmony and expand in every corner they find. <br> Far from figuration, his illustrations have intense, deep strokes and sharp lines that seem to be cut by scissors. <br> In an environment that manifests itself with force, his works remind us that we are still in the midst of nature and every day we have the opportunity to recognize it.</p>
